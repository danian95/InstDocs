Perkin-Elmer LS-55 Fluorimeter
==============================

Procedure
---------

#. Make sure the instrument is turned on. The switch is in the back.
#. Log in with password “Springchem2020” if needed.
#. Open BLDevelopment

#. Click the New Method icon.

#. Use the FL Scan Aquisition Module. Everything else should be set to
   None.
#. Click the Manual Control Tab and make sure that Comport Com1 is
   checked. Everything else should be unchecked.
#. Open the sample compartment by pulling on the top of the light blue
   box. Notice that a nifty sample changer is installed! Make sure that
   the fluorescein sample is in the path of the light beam. If not,
   turn the knob to rotate the samples.

   .. note::
   
      The fourth slot is a little broken, but can be used if you use use the
      microspatula located on top of the PE LS 55 to pull back the clamp. 

#. Back on the Acquisition tab, make sure that the Scan Type is
   Emission, the Ex. and Em. slit widths are set to 6 nm, the scan
   speed is 500 nm/min, and the Gain is set to Low. Click the play
   button and then Start. Click Stop when the window pops up after your
   scan.

   .. tip::
      
      If the data doesn't look great, try making the scan speed slower.

#. Find the maximum of the peak. This is your **Emission Maximum**.
#. Change the Scan Type to Excitation and the Em. WL to the value you
   determined in the last step. You may need to decrease your slit
   widths to 2.5. Identify the maximum here. This is your **Excitation
   Maximum**.
#. Finally, change the scan type back to Emission. This time, change
   your Ex. WL to the value you found in your previous step.
#. When you are finished observing your spectra, close the program.
#. If you are the last person to use the instrument, turn it off.

   .. attention::

      It is **very** important to turn this instrument off to extend the life of
      the bulb.

Questions
---------

1. Why did I make you go back and forth between emission and excitation
   scans?
2. Is there anything interesting about the emission and excitation
   spectra? As in, how do the shapes of these spectra appear?
3. What does slit width do to the data? Why did you need to decrease it?
