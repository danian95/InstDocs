Perkin Elmer Spectrum 400 IR/NIR
================================

We will be using the IR in ATR mode for this module. FTIR is also often used in
transmission mode.

Procedure
---------

1. Make sure the power is on to the spectrometer.
2. Open the Spectrum IR software and log in as Administrator.
3. We will be operating the spectrometer in Attenuated Internal
   Reflectance mode. This simplifies our sample preparation
   significantly because we don’t have to do any sample preparation!
   Make sure the sample stage is clear and the Accumulations is set to
   10 scans. Click Background.
4. When it’s complete, click the dropdown arrown on Scanalyze and then
   Scan and Search. Place the plastic shopping bag on the stage. Keeping
   an eye on the force gauge on the monitor, begin tightening the hammer
   to hold the sample close to the crystal.
5. Once you have a force of about 100, click Scan.
6. Allow the software to finish scanning. It will search a library for a
   compound that matches the spectrum you obtained.
7. When you are finished, close the software. Do not turn off the
   spectrometer. It generally stays on all the time to reduce humidity
   inside the instrument.

Questions
---------

1. What is the result of the library search?
2. Does this match the actual material (inspect the bag for a label)?
3. Using the above procedure, take a look at the underside (the
   non-label side) of the DVD. What is it made out of?
4. Do you think we can put this DVD in a computer and it will still
   work? In other words, is this a destructive or a nondestructive
   technique?
5. What might happen if you try to analyze a material of mixed
   composition?
