Agilent 8890 GC-MS
==================

Procedure
---------

1.  The GC-MS must remain under high vacuum, so it is **always on**.
    Open the Agilent GCQQQ software.
2.  Go to Method > Load Method and find butterscotch.M.
3.  Click the big arrow at the top of the screen.
4.  Type your name in under Operator Name. For Data Path, click Browse.
    Save your data under D:/MassHunter/GCMS/1/data/practice. Name your
    data file something fun and interesting.
5.  Take a look at the sample racks above the GC-MS. We’ll be using the
    Butterscotch extract which is already loaded in one of the trays.
    Find it! Note that the trays have numbers corresponding to the
    individual vials, but also numbers corresponding to the racks
    present. Two rows of racks are numbered 1-3. The racks on the left
    are correct. The racks on the right are actually racks 4-6. On the
    computer, type in the vial number for the Butterscotch Extract and
    select the correct rack from the dropdown (making sure that you
    translate 1 to 4, 2 to 5, and 3 to 6).
6.  OK and run method!
7.  It may appear as if nothing is happening at all as it warms up.
    Please be patient. The PAL autosampler will play some tunes right
    before it’s about to move.
8.  Once the run is complete, open the Qualitative Analysis software.
    Find your data file and open it. If nothing has changed, it should
    automatically identify all of the peaks in your data.
9.  Once you’re finished looking at the software, you may close it.
10. If you are the last person using the GC-MS, go to Method and load
    the standby.M method (just look through the drop down menu as it
    should have recently been used).

.. attention::
   
   When the entire class is finished using the instrument, be sure to set the
   method to **standby.M**. This decreases the flow rate of He (expensive!) and
   lowers the average temperature of the instrument.

Questions
---------

1. We operated the GC-MS in “headspace” mode which means it just pulls
   off the vapor at the top of the sample without actually dipping into
   the liquid. Knowing that, what was the purpose of the
   incubation/shaking chamber?
2. Were all of your peaks well resolved?
3. Name 3 compounds that were identified by the software. Compare that
   to the list of ingredients on the original bottle. How does what you
   found differ from the label on the bottle?
4. Can you determine which compound is most concentrated based on this
   run? How or why not?
