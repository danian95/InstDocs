Quantitative Analysis of Xylene Mixtures by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
===================================================================================

Theory
++++++

Absorption in the infrared region of the spectrum is due to transitions
involving vibrational energy levels. By far the most important application of
infrared spectroscopy is qualitative analysis.  Functional groups can be
identified by their characteristic absorption bands in the infrared.  Also,
infrared spectra are unique for a particular compound, which means that if a
spectrum for an unknown matches a known spectrum, the unknown has been
identified.

For several reasons, infrared absorption is not well suited for
quantitative analysis.  Because sources are weak and detectors insensitive, it
is necessary to record spectra using wide bandwidths.  Since IR peaks are
relatively narrow, this means it is difficult to avoid instrumental deviations
from Beer's Law.  Many of these problems have been circumvented by the use of
Fourier transform instruments where multiple scans can be rapidly obtained and
the signals averaged.  Other problems include solvent absorption and the lack
of suitable optical materials for quantitative measurement of absorption.
Since glass and quartz absorb in the IR, it is necessary to use salt plates to
make IR cells.  Fixed path cells also assist the chemist in improving the
determination.

In this experiment, a quantitative IR analysis of a mixture of
xylenes is performed.  This experiment illustrates the use of an internal
standard to compensate for some of the measurement problems in the IR. The
internal standard is added in equal amount to both standards and sample and
their infrared spectra obtained using standard salt plates.  The ratio of
absorbance of compounds of interest (m- and p-xylene in this experiment) to
internal standard (o-xylene) is measured and compared to absolute absorbance
values. The idea is that variations in sample volume, cell transmittance, etc.,
will affect both internal standard and compound of interest equally, and,
therefore, the ratio of absorbances will be independent of these variables. In
a second experiment, the same samples spectra will be obtained using a fixed
path cell with similar data analysis.

Experimental
++++++++++++

Apparatus
---------

* Fourier Transform IR (:doc:`/instruments/PESpectrum400/docs`)
* 2 salt plates and holder
* Fixed path cell
* Disposable pipets
* Luer-lock syringe without needle

Chemicals
---------

* cyclohexane
* o-, m-, p- xylene
* Methylene chloride or chloroform for cleaning salt plates between trials

Procedure
---------

#. Prepare, in 10 mL volumetric flasks, eight standard solutions all of which
   have a composition consisting of 20.0% by volume o-xylene and using
   cyclohexane as solvent with 0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 30.0, and
   35.0% by volume of both standards m-xylene and p-xylene. 

   .. admonition:: Example

      The last sample has 35.0 % m-xylene, 35.0 % p-xylene, 20.0 % o-xylene,
      and made to mark with cyclohexane.

#. Obtain an unknown consisting of a mixture of m-xylene and p-xylene in
   cyclohexane. Record the unknown number!

   .. important::
      Return the unknown sample to the refrigerator after use.

#. Pipet 2 mL of o-xylene internal standard into a 10 mL volumetric and dilute to the mark with unknown.

   .. tip::
      Use Pasteur pipet to dilute.

#. Using a Pasteur pipet, place two drops of the standard solution between the salt plates.

   .. caution::
      The salt plates are easily etched by moisture on your hands.  Hold them
      by the edges and rinse them thoroughly with methylene chloride between
      samples and when finished.  Store in a desiccator.

   Record the spectra of the standards and unknown using the available Fourier
   transform infrared instrument.  Keep in mind that data analysis requires
   being able to measure absorbances.  If the absorbance peaks are too large
   --- this operation can not be accomplished.  Recently using a PE 2000, all
   samples had to be diluted 1:10 to accomplish this analysis!

#. Obtain the spectra of the standards and samples using a fixed pathlength
   liquid cell.  This cell must be loaded with a needle-less luer lock syringe
   obtained from the instructor.  The faces of this cell are again made of salt
   and the same rules as above still apply.   Between trials, flush with
   methylene chloride.

   All spectra should be save in a directory named after your lab group (limited
   to 8 characters of course). When you are done with the lab, all files should
   be deleted from the hard drive.

#. Using one (1, uno, singular) sample, run a single scan vs a single
   background scan, 10 scans vs 10 background scans, and 100 scans vs. 100
   background scans.  Compare the signal to noise ratio relative to number of
   scans.  Report and discuss this in your report.

Treatment of Data
-----------------

1. The bands used for the analysis are:

   ======== ==========================
   o-xylene 13.5 microns (micrometers)
   m-xylene 13.0 or 14.5 microns
   p-xylene 12.6 microns
   ======== ==========================

   Use the instruments computer to obtain the absorbance values at the above
   frequencies (what are these frequencies in wavenumbers?)

2. Plot working curves of both absorbance of each standard and the ratio of the
   absorbance of the desired constituent to that of the internal standard
   versus concentration (in %) for both sample holders. Determine the
   composition of the unknown using these curves.

3. Compare the two sample holders.  Is it necessary or desirable to use the
   internal standard approach with both, either, or neither of the sample
   holders.  Comment.

Questions
---------
1. How does a dispersive IR instrument differ from a Fourier transform IR
   instrument?  Include both instrumental differences and relative
   advantages/disadvantages.

2. What are the specific advantages and disadvantages of a double-beam
   dispersive instrument vs a single beam dispersive instrument?  With this in
   mind, why don’t companies make a double beam Fourier transform instrument?

3. Discuss the particular advantages of optics such as beam splitters for
   infrared instruments: NaCl, KBr, CaF\ :sub:`2`, LiF, CaBr\ :sub:`2`, and
   quartz.  Compare specifically such quantities as useful wavelength range and
   resolution.

4. Historically, IR has been plagued by poor stability of sources and
   detectors.  Based on your results, does the PE FTIR suffer from the
   difficulties?   This is not a simple yes/no question. Explain!

CHEM322 Spring '23 Procedure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Make sure the power is on to the spectrometer.
#. Open the Spectrum IR software and log in as Administrator.
#. Locate the dessicator around the FT-IR and find two salt plates
   (they’re kind of hidden in with all of the mess) and place on the
   bench top on a Kimwipe.
#. Clean the salt plates with methylene chloride (or other non-aqueous
   solvent)
#. Using a Pasture Pipet, place about 2-3 drops of your
   standard solution between both of the salt plates and record its
   spectra. There is a special slip for the salt plates and it has a
   triangular ledge to it to rest the salt plates on.
#. Once you have the sample loaded make sure your parameters are set to:

   a. scanning from 600 |cm1| - 800 |cm1|
   b. accumulations: 3 scans
   c. blank has been measured before hand using 0% m/p-xylene solution

#.  you may now begin to run through your samples ensuring that the
    plates were cleaned with DCM.
#.  Once the samples have been run through using the salt plates, you
    may now switch the sample holder to a fixed path length cell. This
    is hidden in one of the drawers that you are going to have to
    rummage through… sorry the instrumental lab is a mess. It looks like
    a **vintage**, black cassette tape (do y’all still know what that
    looks like?) with a clear center and two little spikes sticking out
    of it to flush the solution through.
#.  This whole cell goes into the FT-IR so make sure the salt plate
    ledge has been removed.
#.  Flush the cell with a needleless syringe with DCM and load to run a
    new blank with your standard solution . 

    .. tip::
       Ensure that a mL or more of DCM is passed through the cell before
       introducing new samples.

    .. tip::
       Flushing is not necessary if analyzing a series dilution from low
       concentration to high concentration as long as enough sample is added to
       push the previous sample out.

#. Load your parameters to:

   +----------------+-----------+
   | parameter      | value     |
   +================+===========+
   | abscissa units | wave #    |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | ordinate units | A         |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | resolution     | 4 |cm1|   |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | accumulations  | 3 scans   |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | start          | 800 |cm1| |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | end            | 600 |cm1| |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | scan type      | sample    |
   +----------------+-----------+

#. Now one can compare number of scans to background for the last part
   of the experiment.
#. Change the parameters at the bottom for a 1 v 1, 10 v 10, and 100 v
   100 scans v background.
#. Save all data and export to a USB and shut down the software.
