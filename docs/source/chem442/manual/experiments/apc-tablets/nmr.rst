Analysis of APC Tablets by NMR Spectroscopy
===========================================

Theory
++++++

Relative amounts of caffeine, phenacetin and aspirin can be determined by
either of two methods: (1) by standard comparison, using the caffeine standard
to calibrate the integrator; or (2) by the absolute method, using only the
spectrum of the unknown and determining the relative percentage of each
component by weight, normalizing so that the total percentage equals 100%.

Experimental
++++++++++++

Apparatus
---------

* proton nmr spectrometer (:doc:`/instruments/Bruker400MHzNMR/docs`)
* nmr tubes (2), 5 mm
* microspatula that fits into an nmr tube (can be made by pounding a copper wire)

Chemicals
---------

* deuterated chloroform
* tetramethysilane [TMS] (1%) in deuterated chloroform
* aspirin, 20 to 40 mg per tube in 1 mL of 1% TMS; sealed and labeled
* caffeine, 20 to 40 mg per tube in 1 mL of 1% TMS; sealed and labeled
* phenacetin, 20 to 40 mg per tube in 1 mL of 1% TMS; sealed and labeled
* APC tablet, finely ground (Use no more than 100 mg for analysis due to solubility of aspirin in chloroform.)


Procedure
----------

1. Read the specific operating instructions for the :doc:`/instruments/Bruker400MHzNMR/docs`.
   Use ethylbenzene to make sure the instrument is on scale and working
   properly.

2. Three color coded tubes containing 20 to 40 mg of each of the three
   components and TMS in CDCl\ :sub:`3` have been prepared.  The spectrum and
   the integral of the spectrum of the contents of each tube should be taken.
   Examination of these spectra will allow suitably non-overlapping peaks to be
   chosen for the quantitative analysis of each component in the APC tablet.

3. Clean two nmr tubes by rinsing several times with chloroform.  Into one
   tube, accurately weigh (to 0.1 mg) approximately 100 mg of the APC tablet
   powder.  Do not exceed 100 mg because aspirin is only slightly soluble in
   chloroform.  Into the other tube, weigh accurately (to 0.1 mg) approximately
   50 mg of pure caffeine.  To each tube add 1 mL of 1% TMS (CDCl\ :sub:`3`) and
   immediately close both tubes.
  
4. Using the caffeine standard just prepared, adjust sensitivity and resolution
   of the instrument. Take a spectrum and integral of the known caffeine solution.
 
5. As quickly as possible and without changing any instrument parameters,
   replace the caffeine tube with the unknown tube, scan and integrate.

Treatment of Data
+++++++++++++++++

1. From the spectra of the three components, determine which peaks in the
   unknown belongs to which component and determine the number of protons per
   peak.  Select peaks for each component to be used for the quantitative
   analysis.
  
2. Determine the relative amounts of caffeine, phenacetin, and aspirin (by
   percent weight) by two methods:

   Standard comparison method
       Use the caffeine standard to calibrate the integrator and determine the
       percent of each component.

   Absolute method 
       Using only the spectrum of the unknown, determine the relative percent
       of each component by weight, normalized so that the sum of the three
       percents adds to 100%.

Questions
+++++++++
1. Evaluate NMR as a technique for the determination of aspirin at a trace
   level.  How does it compare with other analytical techniques such as
   fluorescence, UV-visible spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography?

2. Compare and discuss the APC tablet results from the two parts of this
   experiment.
