Lab Notebook
============
Notebooks must be complete or your career may rapidly come down to ‘You want to
Supersize that?’  Companies cannot afford to have OSHA or EPA or FDA or DEP or
... come down with million dollar fines because you did not feel like writing
something down!  Proof that you were first to try something can make the
difference between a patent (royalties in) or not (payments out).  And then
there is ISO 9000/9001 — international rules for the documentation of methods..

ISO 9000/9001 is an international program that certifies your lab, company, or
organization follows accepted practices in the workplace.  It states that your
firm follows the same methods each time you manufacture or analyze a product and
have the **documentation** to prove it.  All changes in practice must be
**documented** and it must be proven that the changes will not affect the
results.  Because of ISO 9000/9001, patents, fines, not to mention downsizing,
promotions, ..., it is very important that you have a complete record of what
you have done.  SOURCES!

Title
    What is it you are trying today?

References
    Sources for information or methods (PD what have you read, SS what did PD recommend)

Introduction
    Theory behind the experiment, references to similar experiences (this
    section will be longer for PD than SS - include when conferences occurred
    and results thereof)

Materials
    An **organized** listing of chemicals (brand, lot #), equipment (brand,
    model), and instrumentation (brand, model, serial #) used in the experiment;
    types of cells; (PD may refer to pages in SS notebook)

Procedure
    The actual procedures used with enough detail to allow someone else to
    repeat the experiment using your notebook.  The SS must have complete
    procedure, the PD can record their role and refer to SS notebook by SS name,
    experiment title, page number  Appropriate data should be recorded in table
    fashion in the SS notebook.  Don’t forget to record observations AND all
    instrument settings!!

Results
    An Excel or other table with results can be taped into the notebook with
    reference to location of original file (HD/FD id, complete file name, i.e.
    :file:`C:\\01292012\\instrumental\\UV lab\\results uv1.qpw`)

Calculations
    The template showing formulas can be taped in and/or a complete sample
    calculation can be entered into the notebook

Conclusion
    A couple paragraphs that look at the results with comments about their
    validity and potential errors.  As part of the conclusion, I will also be
    looking for some comments involving the instrument and analyte — Why was
    this technique chosen?  Was it general applicability or something special
    about the analyte?  What is the detection limit for the technique and its
    linear dynamic range?  What other techniques would work for this analysis?

Sign and Date
    You should get in the habit of initialing each page and each days work.
    Date each day so if questions come up, it will be easier to find the
    information in your partners notebook.  You should also initial each error
    that is made and if a datum, note why the value was changed.

Entries should be made promptly and habitually.  Include poor results as well as
successful ones.  Poor results should be labeled with a note giving possible
reasons for their problems.  Remember, this notebook is a legal record and only
a complete record yields confidence.
