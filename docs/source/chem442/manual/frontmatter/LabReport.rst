Laboratory Report Format
========================
When writing laboratory reports in CHEM442, students should observe the following rules:

* Reports should be written using a word processor (double spaced).  Use 1" margins - both sides, top, and bottom.
* The language used in reports should be concise and precise.  Reports should be
  written using the third person, simple past tense, passive voice.  Do not use
  personal pronouns.  The reports will be graded for spelling, grammar, verb
  tense and voice, sentence structure, and logic of presentation.
* Laboratory reports should be separated into several distinct sections as
  discussed below.  The information from each section should not be mixed up!
  Each of the sections should be labeled. “Long” reports should include all
  sections listed below in proper order.  “Short” reports will leave out some
  sections per the table handed out with the tentative experiment schedule,
  however, declarations made in lab will take precedence (formats can change!).

Each section of the report is designed with a particular purpose in mind.  For
example, an abstract is often published separately from the rest of the work.
It, therefore, must be a report in miniature, clearly stating the problem, the
approach, and the results.  The remainder of the report should be written as a
cohesive package.  The theory and necessary equations and formulas are
introduced (introduction), the technique and procedures given (experimental),
the results presented and discussed in some detail [nauseating?] and conclusions
from the results presented (results and discussion).  The references and
appendix given supporting evidence.  This style is similar to that of journal
publications in the sciences. For short reports, the introduction and materials
and methods sections should not be submitted.

Coverpage
---------
The coverpage gives the experiment title (be imaginative! DO NOT use title of
the separate as your title!), date of report submission, your name and your
partners name(s), and your abstract.

Abstract
--------
An abstract summarizes the principle findings of the work reported in the report
and therefore, although it is the first part of the report, logically, the
abstract should be written last!  The abstract must stand alone and should never
refer to other sections of the lab report. It must accurately reflect the
content of the paper and should contain the following:

1. The :dfn:`object` of the experiment.  **Do not write** “The object of the
   experiment ...” or “In this experiment it was ...” or any similar redundancy.

     A solid state fluoride ion \(F⁻\) selective electrode was used to determine the
     mass percent fluoride ion in two different commercial toothpaste samples (Pete’s
     of Vermont Maple, Lot 1498263 and AquaCool Peach Gel, Lot 6 ).  In addition, the
     electrode was evaluated for the analysis by recovery study.

2. The :dfn:`method` used to achieve the objective. Be specific about
   specialized equipment (‘a Bausch and Lomb Spectronic 20’ not ‘a colorimeter’)
   and about the actual form of the species used chemically.

     A series of standards were prepared over six orders utilizing TISAB
     for matrix correction. Fluoride was extracted from the toothpaste by boiling
     the mixture for five minutes.  To one sample of each was added 0.100 mmole
     F⁻ ion. Potentials were measured using an Orion combination electrode (model
     #: 9609BN) and a FisherBrand pH/mV ion-analyzer (Accumet AP60).

3. The actual :dfn:`results` found.
    
     The maple toothpaste was found to contain 0.145 ± 0.003 % F⁻ (-3.3 % error)
     with a 96.7 % recovery of the spike. The peach contained  0.064 ± 0.009 %
     F⁻ (-57%) with a 56.0 % recovery.

4. A :dfn:`conclusion`.

     The calibration plot was linear to 4.5 orders of magnitude as
     predicted by the manufacturer.  The electrode was shown to be effective at
     measuring fluoride content in toothpaste as witnessed by the maple flavored
     paste with both good accuracy and precision and a high recovery.  The
     effectiveness, however, depends on the sample and perhaps the treatment of
     the paste or an addition to the TISAB buffer to improve the removal of
     fluoride ion from the paste matrix.

All abbreviations should be introduced to the reader in both the abstract and
the introduction by showing the abbreviation in parens following the full name
or word.  For example: “... aluminum metal (Al) ...”.

Introduction
------------

.. sidebar::

   2 to 5 pages in length

The Introduction section should present a general overview of the THEORY behind
the experiment to the reader.  It should include a brief explanation of the
*reasoning* behind the measurements made in the laboratory.  All *equations* used in
writing of the report should be presented and their utility towards reaching the
final goal illustrated.  Likewise, all pertinent chemical *reactions* performed in
the experiment should be presented and discussed. All equations and reactions
should be numbered for easier referencing within the text (as in the separates).
All equations and reactions should be separated from the main body of the text
using blank lines (also as in the separates).  Structures of the main analyte
should be shown for organic media along with discussion of their applicable
physical properties.

Materials and Methods
---------------------

.. sidebar:: 

   1 page in length

Open with a list *in prose form*, of all specialized equipment and especially
instrumentation including model name and number (e.g. Milton Roy Spectronic 20
Gensys, BU # 091234) and a list of chemicals identifying manufacturer when
possible (potassium acid phthalate, Fisher acidimetric standard, Cat # P5-1234).
Subsequent paragraphs should summarize the procedure in sufficient detail that
another chemist could repeat the experiment.   The presentation should be
written in prose form, not as an outline.  Give a general overview of the
experimental steps but do not copy the manual!  Refer to the manual where
necessary noting deviations announced in lab.  Include approximate masses and
concentrations, and types of glassware used (this can be done by significant
figures: “...measure  25.00 mL ...” and “... obtain a 25 mL aliquot ... “ and “
... pipet 25 mL of the sample... “  all mean the same thing).   Recall that
sentences should never begin with a number.

Results and Discussion
----------------------

.. sidebar::

   1 to 5 pages of text
  
This section presents the results of the experiment using tables and figures
(including graphs).  The section should begin with a well-written paragraph
leading the reader through the maze of tables and figures beyond.  All tables
should be numbered and titled (e.g. “Table 3: Calculated densities and
percent errors”).  The figures should be labeled with a figure number, a
descriptive caption (*do not* simply repeat the axis labels), and have axes that
are clearly labeled to same number of significant digits as the data was
collected.  Raw data should not be confused with the results of an
experiment.  The experimental data sheets containing the raw data should be
placed in the appendix section.  Following the presentation of the results,
this section should also give an explanation of the results with a postulate
of the sources of experimental error and a discussion of what the results
mean and of what use the experiment was.  The discussion will often be
shorter but will usually be worth more points because it shows how you
thought about and understood the experiment.
  
Results should be placed in a table using the format:

+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| individual trial data                                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| experimental mean ± absolute standard deviation (with units) |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| relative standard deviation (in ppt)                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| true mean (95%) = ### to ### (units)                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Remember to discuss the results.  Take a critical view of your values and
compare to what is expected!

.. important::
   Post-lab questions are presented in many of the experiments you will perform
   this semester. You **must** answer these questions in your discussion.

Conclusion
----------

.. sidebar::

   1-2 paragraphs 
  
What can we conclude about the sample, method, and the instrument in this study?
Especially consider how your results compare to theory!

References
----------
List all references used in the experiment (e.g. the lab manual) and in the
writing of the report (textbooks and other sources).  Each citation and
reference should be numbered for easy reference during report writing.\
:sup:`1,2`
Proper format includes the author(s),text title, publisher, date of publication,
and pages used (if applicable).  E.g.

.. tip::
   You should really use a reference manager. Software exists to keep track of
   appropriate formatting and number for you. Please speak to your instructor
   for more details.

Appendices
----------
Your original experimental values should be presented along with a profusely
labeled spreadsheet (Excel, LibreOffice, etc.). Use proper significant figures
at all times.  These should be contained in the original data sheets from the
notebook. 

..
   New this term should be a table containing a list of all chemicals
   used including manufacturer, retail price per bottle and cost per sample used
   (and wasted) and a list of instrument peripherals (salt plates or cells,
   specialized glassware, etc.)

One very common error is to consider the appendix as part of the report and
refer to data contained in it.  This is in error. If you must refer to the data,
it belongs in the Results and Discussion section. Each formal lab report is actually a compilation
of three parts:  the lab report, a compendium of report called the abstract
which is placed before the report but which must be complete enough to stand on
its own thus refers to nothing else nor is it referred to, and the appendix
which is the communication between you and the instructor showing all the work
that you really did thus also is not referred to or from.

Each student should make certain that he or she does his or her own work in
writing lab reports.  If the grader is convinced that two (or more) individuals
people wrote a report and submitted it twice with minor revisions, each student
will receive half (or third or fourth...) the average score on the first
occurrence. Future repetitions will be scored as a zero. Note also that
substantial penalties exist for plagiarism.

The laboratory reports are graded on how well the format was followed, the
organization and clarity of the writing, the soundness of the arguments for the
conclusions made as well as for grammar, spelling, tense, sentence structure,
proper terminology , and the degree of accuracy of any analytical determination
where applicable.  Neatness does count because the student has ample time to
organize and write each report.

If this looks familiar - congratulations!  You read it in the 341 lab manual.
If not and you made it this far, thanks for reading this time.

.. topic:: Recall the ancient proverb:

   “A sloppy manuscript often reflects careless experimentation.”
