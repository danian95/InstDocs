Analysis of a Multivitamin using ICP-OES
========================================

Sample Prep
-----------

There is a manual in the lab for how to assemble the
carrousel (but it is also attached here in case you wanted to read
beforehand etc.)

#. You will need to weigh 3 multivitamins on the scale and crush in a
   mortar/pestle

#. Prepare 3 unknown samples weighed to 500 mg, and three unknown
   samples to 100 mg to run.

#. *Need the amounts measured and how much goes in the carrousel?*

#. Ultimately these weighed portions will each go into a specfic
   chamber

Find the ginormous microwave/incubator (by the sink)

#. Place the carrousel in
#. Feed the fiberoptic tube into the control chamber
#. Press “vitamin” on the screen
#. Select EasyPrep Plus and click “Auto”

   .. note::

      Heads up, once the heating period is done, the system will hold the
      samples at that temperature until you come in to stop the cycle… the
      first group were unlucky and did not realize this (we waited
      unnecessarily for 30 extra minutes)

#. Once the run is complete, bring the carousel back into the lab and
   use the wrench to carefully unscrew the bolts slightly

   a. These chambers contain nitric acid in the gaseous form (brown/rust
      colored)
   b. Place them in hood 65
   c. Unscrew completely and let the gas escape

#. Organize the 250 mL flasks for the unknown (we had 6)

   a. Fill slightly with DI |H2O| so you are not adding water directly to the
      acid (if you do this the other way around, you will create an immense
      amount of heat and a very volatile solution that may begin to
      splash/boil… not good)
   b. In the hood and using a funnel, add the contents of the chamber to
      the volumetric flasks (don’t lose track of which flask is for which
      sample)
   c. Rinse the chambers with a bottle of DI |H2O| and into the sample flasks
   d. Fill to the mark with DI |H2O| for each flask
   e. Place samples into smaller tubes for the autosampler to run (These
      are in a large bag under the instrument in the cabinet)
   f. You can label them

      .. attention::

         Just do NOT label Dr. Hallen’s sample rack!

   g. Press “Auto sampler”
   h. Let the samples run

Once these samples are done, go ahead and clean up. Anything containing
heavy metals needs to go into the waste containers in the hood. Anything
containing just the nitric acid and vitamins can go down the drain and
be washed with copious amounts of water. The vitamin sample tubes can be
dumped down the drain, rinsed with water, and tossed in the trash. Any
of the volumetric flasks used to the standard curves (the ones that came
from the small blueish rack under the instrument in the cabinet) MUST go
back into the rack… These are used by Dr. Hallen specifically for the
standard curves.
