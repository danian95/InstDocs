Perkin Elmer Spectrum 400 IR/NIR
================================

Procedure
---------

#. Make sure the power is on to the spectrometer.
#. Open the Spectrum IR software and log in as Administrator.
#. Locate the dessicator around the FT-IR and find two salt plates
   (they’re kind of hidden in with all of the mess) and place on the
   bench top on a Kimwipe.
#. Clean the salt plates with methylene chloride (or other non-aqueous
   solvent)
#. Using a Pasture Pipet, place about 2-3 drops of your
   standard solution between both of the salt plates and record its
   spectra. There is a special slip for the salt plates and it has a
   triangular ledge to it to rest the salt plates on.
#. Once you have the sample loaded make sure your parameters are set to:

   a. scanning from 600 |cm1| - 800 |cm1|
   b. accumulations: 3 scans
   c. blank has been measured before hand using 0% m/p-xylene solution

#.  you may now begin to run through your samples ensuring that the
    plates were cleaned with DCM.
#.  Once the samples have been run through using the salt plates, you
    may now switch the sample holder to a fixed path length cell. This
    is hidden in one of the drawers that you are going to have to
    rummage through… sorry the instrumental lab is a mess. It looks like
    a **vintage**, black cassette tape (do y’all still know what that
    looks like?) with a clear center and two little spikes sticking out
    of it to flush the solution through.
#.  This whole cell goes into the FT-IR so make sure the salt plate
    ledge has been removed.
#.  Flush the cell with a needleless syringe with DCM and load to run a
    new blank with your standard solution . 

    .. tip::
       Ensure that a mL or more of DCM is passed through the cell before
       introducing new samples.

    .. tip::
       Flushing is not necessary if analyzing a series dilution from low
       concentration to high concentration as long as enough sample is added to
       push the previous sample out.

#. Load your parameters to:

   +----------------+-----------+
   | parameter      | value     |
   +================+===========+
   | abscissa units | wave #    |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | ordinate units | A         |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | resolution     | 4 |cm1|   |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | accumulations  | 3 scans   |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | start          | 800 |cm1| |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | end            | 600 |cm1| |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | scan type      | sample    |
   +----------------+-----------+

#. Now one can compare number of scans to background for the last part
   of the experiment.
#. Change the parameters at the bottom for a 1 v 1, 10 v 10, and 100 v
   100 scans v background.
#. Save all data and export to a USB and shut down the software.
