Perkin-Elmer LS-55 Fluorimeter

A fluorimeter measures the fluorescence or light emitted by different
fluorescing objects. Fluorescence occurs when light of specific
wavelength hits and excites electrons in a sample, and the electrons
in that sample instantly emit or fluoresce light of a different
wavelength. Typically, molecules with conjugated and/or aromatic systems exhibit
fluorescence. Ideally, emission and excitation spectra for the same
analyte are mirror images of eachother with the excitation wavelenght
being shorter than the emission wavelenght. In fluorescence
spectroscopy, the light source and the detector are oriented at a 90
degree angle. Unlike UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy is
a measure of the ability of an analyte to emit light.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

1.  Make sure the instrument is turned on. The switch for the instrument is on
    the left side towards the back when facing towards the front of the
    instrument.
2.  Turn on the monitor for the corresponding computer and log in with
    password :kbd:`spring2021` if needed.
3.  Open :program:`BLDevelopment`

4.  Click the New Method icon.

5.  Use the FL Scan Aquisition Module. Everything else should be set to
    None.
6.  Click the Manual Control Tab and make sure that Comport Com1 is
    checked. Everything else should be unchecked.
7.  Open the sample compartment by pulling on the top of the light blue
    box. Notice that a nifty sample changer is installed! This allows
    for you to be able to load up to three samples at the same time (the
    fourth compartment is a little broken…). Remember to turn the knob
    after each scan! Don’t be a rookie! 

    .. note::
   
       The fourth slot can be used if you use use the microspatula located on top
       of the PE LS 55 to pull back the clamp. 

    .. tip::

       Cuvette lids can be used to boost the cuvette if there is not enough sample
       to analyze.

8.  Back on the Acquisition tab, make sure that the Scan Type is
    Emission. The Ex. and Em. slit widths should be set to a wavelength
    that allows for the whole spectra to be seen. Decreasing the slit
    width adjusts how much light is hitting the sample --- more light
    makes the peaks broader. Decrease the slits to ensure your limits
    aren’t exceeded for measurment! The scan speed is around 500 nm/min;
    if the spectra appears noisy, that means the speed is too fast. Lower the
    scan speed to resolve these noisy peaks.
    Ensure the Gain is set to Low; this is the numerical multiplier that
    attributes to the amplitude of the signal. 

    .. note:: 

       These should be adjusted in order to find the clearest maximized excitation
       and emission peaks. Start with your most concentrated sample and adjust what
       is above to make sure its peak is seen on the computer.

9.  Click the play button and then Start. Click Stop when the window
    pops up after your scan. The window asks if you would like to scan
    sample 2.
10. Find the maximum of the peak using the icon in the tool bar at the
    top of the page. Click the icon (a spectrum with a vertical line)
    and use the mouse to position the vertical line in the center of the
    peak of interest. This is your **Emission Maximum**. The Em WL will
    be displayed on the x axis.
11. Change the Scan Type to Excitation and the Em. WL to the value you
    determined in the last step. You may need to further decrease your
    slit widths (2.5 nm is the minimum). Identify the maximum here. This
    is your **Excitation Maximum**.
12. Finally, change the scan type back to Emission. This time, change
    your Ex. WL to the value you found in your previous step.
13. When you are choosing the range to scan for your molecule, keep in
    mind that the emission spectra will always be to the right of the
    excitation maximum at a higher wavelength, and the excitation spectra will
    always be to the
    left of the emission maximum at a lower wavelength

    .. tip::
       After obtaining your emission spectrum, choose a wavelength range
       slightly below your emission peak maximum. This will reduce the
       possibility of obtaining peaks in error.

14. Finally, change the scan type back to Emission. This time, change
    your Ex. WL to the value you found in your previous step.
15. If making a standard curve, click on the New Method icon, but this
    time use the FL Read aquistion module. This will allow you to obtain
    the intensity.
16. Adjust the parameters for the Em WL and Ex WL to the maximum
    wavelength you determined in the previous scans. Use the same slit
    width for both Em and Ex as used before, too. Make sure to blank the
    instrument before running your samples.
17. Now you may run your samples by clicking the play button and then
    Start. Make sure that if you have more than one sample in the
    carousel, you are spinning the knob counter-clockwise each turn to correlate each
    sample! (In this mode, after you click *Start* to run each sample,
    the measurement will automatically appear after the scan and you are
    able to just click *Start* again to run the next sample). If the intensity
    of the sample exceeds 1004.99 for a calibration curve, then the sample may
    be too concentrated and should not be used as data in the curve.
18. If you have more than three samples to run, you should remember to
    keep the blank in the instrument carousel so you recalibrate it each
    time you open the cover.
19. When you are finished, save your data as .ascii, close the program and turn
    off the machine.
