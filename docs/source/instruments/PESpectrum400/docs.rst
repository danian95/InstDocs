Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique used to
obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or emission of a solid, liquid
or gas. An FTIR spectrometer simultaneously collects high-resolution
spectral data over a wide spectral range. This confers a significant
advantage over a dispersive spectrometer, which measures intensity over
a narrow range of wavelengths at a time.

The term Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy originates from the
fact that a Fourier transform (a mathematical process) is required to
convert the raw data into the actual spectrum.

Procedure
---------

-  Before you start making solutions in the Pchem lab, ensure that the
   Perkin Elmer Spectrum 400 FT-IR/FT-NIR Spectrometer is turned on (it
   should not be turned off)

-  Log into the :program:`Spectrum IR` software on the computer

-  The first set of samples are analyzed using the movable salt plates
   (in a desiccator to the left of the instrument)
  
Salt Plate Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In the Tabs on the bottom of the screen, you will be able to adjust
   several factors for your experiment such as: sample name, save
   location, instrument beam path, advanced settings, and basic
   instrument set-up

-  In this experiment, you will mainly be focusing on just sample name,
   save location, and basic instrument set-up to adjust a few parameters

-  It is also noted to adjust the parameters at the top of the page as
   well so that they reflect what you have included in the bottom
   (specifically *Sample ID*)

Sample Naming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  You can enter a name for your sample in both the *Auto-name* and
   *Auto-description* box after the *[nnn]* listed
  
   .. image:: images/naming_sample.jpg

-  Sometimes the auto-naming function does not work as you would like,
   so you may manually enter a name for the file up at the top of the
   page where it says ‚ÄòSample ID‚Äô.

Data Collection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Under *Auto-Save Options* you can chose where your files will save
   and the file format to export as

Basic Instrument Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Here you can chose the wavelength range you wish to measure your
   samples within, the resolution, scan type, accumulations (how many
   scans), and units (absorbance, etc.)

Scanning Your Samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Before scanning any of your samples, you must collect a background
   spectrum beforehand

-  The sample compartment should contain the salt plate with your
   solvent.

-  Click *Scan*

   .. image:: images/scanfirst.jpg

#. Starting with the lowest concentration sample, place several drops (2
   or 3) of your sample onto the salt plate using a Pasteur pipet
#. Load the salt plate into the sample holder. Be sure to only touch the
   outer edges of the salt plates to insert it into the holder.
#. You may notice that the ‚ÄúScan‚Äù button you used has changed to a
   slightly different icon after running the background (it will still
   say *Scan*)
#. Click *Scan* and notice that a green progress bar appears at the
   bottom of the Viewing Pane
#. When the scan is complete, you will see your spectrum appear in the
   Viewing Pane
#. You can see a list of all of the scans you run below the Viewing
   Pane, as well as under the *Results* tab listed near the top

   .. image:: images/results.jpg1.jpg

#. After each scan, remove the salt plates carefully, and clean with
   methylene chloride between uses. This done by adding 2 drops to each
   salt plate and letting the plates air dry. 

   .. caution::
      The salt plates are very fragile, so when you go to clean them make sure
      to have a kim wipe down on the benchtop to set them on.

#. Load your next sample onto the plates and insert them into the
   compartment within the instrument
#. Continue this process for the rest of your samples by repeating the above
   steps
   

Data Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Determine the peak height (essentially the maximum absorbance) of the
   spectrum for each visible peak int he regions of interest

-  You can do so by either exporting your data and estimating, or you
   can utilize the *Peak Height* function within the software

   .. image:: images/peak_height.jpg

Fixed Pathlength Cell Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Similarly, you will run your samples again using a fixed pathlength
   cell to determine which method is better at analyzing your samples
#. Using a plastic syringe, you will inject your sample into the cell
   (it may overflow slightly)
#. Following the sample procedure above, you will run each of your
   samples, flushing the fixed cell with methylene chloride in between
   runs. 

   .. tip::
      Starting with the least concentrated sample and working up to the most
      concentrated sample will greatly increase the accuracy of the data for
      fixed salt plates.

#. Once all of your scans has finished you can analyze your data similar
   to the steps provided above when using the salt plates.
