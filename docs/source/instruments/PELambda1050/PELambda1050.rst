UV-Vis-NIR refers to ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared.
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometers use a light source to
illuminate a sample with light across the UV to the visible wavelength
range of the electromagnetic spectrum (typically 190 to 900 nm). UV-Vis
Spectroscopy (or Spectrophotometry) is a quantitative technique used to
measure how much a chemical substance absorbs light. This is done by
measuring the intensity of light that passes through a sample with
respect to the intensity of light through a reference sample or blank.

Procedure
---------

1. Make sure the power is on to the spectrometer (well before the wet
   prep of your solution samples, duh!). The switch is around the back.
2. Open the PerkinElmer UV WinLab software and log in with Analyst.
3. Open the pre-made method “Scan”.
4. Once “scan” is up and running, perform an auto-zero with absolutely
   **nothing** in the machine.
5. On the left sie of the screen, there is a tab that reads “data
   collection”. This will allow you to see an electronic view of the
   whole instrument and change individual parameters.
6. Set the following parameters:

   a. scan from: 700 nm-300 nm (or other desired wavelength range)

      .. tip::
         The first scan should be broad to avoid missing absorbance peaks.
         Subsequent scans can be performed over smaller wavelength ranges once
         the absorbance peaks of the analyte are determined.

   b. The other parameters can be kept at the default settings.

7.  Now you are ready to run the blank (the primary component(s) of the
    sample matrix: e.g. DI water) and the samples. Set up a sample
    method under the sample ID tab… should pop up when you first open
    the “scan” method. Add your desired amount of samples making sure
    you include the blank.
8.  Place a two-sided frosted quartz cuvette in the **front** cell
    holder with your blank first, close the lid, and press the orange
    triangle to run.
9.  The instrument will instruct you what sample to place in the cell
    holder next, so just make sure you’re competant enough to follow the
    directions 🙂.
10. Once all of your samples have been run, open “Send to DPV” at the
    top of the screen. This allows you to see all of your samples
    over-layed on one another.
11. To export all of your data using an excel friendly format: press
    file > export > .csv. Then save to your desired location on the
    desktop and drag to your USB.
12. If you are the last one to use the machine, ensure the program is
    closed and the instrument is turned off.
