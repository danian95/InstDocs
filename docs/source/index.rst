   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome
=======

This is a collection of the shared instrumentation documentation available to
Bloomsburg University faculty, staff, and students. Each instrument has a
dedicated page listing the technical details of the instrument as well as
general procedures for operating the instrument.

.. note::

   This documentation is a **work in progress**. During the Spring 2024 semester,
   students enrolled in CHEM442: Instrumental Analysis will be adding details to
   the instrument pages as they work in the laboratory.
